This is a log of bugs I have found and status of fixes.
Does not include known bugs that are part of project.

1) ipython broken in various ways - fixed
    upgraded Werkzeug to 0.15.5 and removed ipython from requirements.txt since I already have it installed outside VENV.

2) SQL Alchemy in_() does not work for relationships, have to make list of ids.
