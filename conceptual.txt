1) How is the logged in user being kept track of?

@app.before_request
def add_user_to_g():
    """If we're logged in, add curr user to Flask global."""

    if CURR_USER_KEY in session:
        g.user = User.query.get(session[CURR_USER_KEY])

    else:
        g.user = None

before_request registers a function to run before each request. 

This sets g.user as a variable that can be accessed by all view functions
Functionally similar to global variable even though it isn't one. 

2) What is Flask's g object?

g is an object provided by Flask, it is a global namespace for holding any data you want.
A before_request handler could set g.user, which will be accessible to the route and other functions.

g cannot store data across requests, need to use another storage method for that.
